                    <h2 class="head">Motivation</h2>

                    <p class="content2">My design inspiration came from my interest in psychology and stumbling across Carl Jung's great work which helped me on my life journey. His work is deep and profound and especially his work on dream anaylsis.</p>

                    <p class="content2">He was one of the most influential psychologist of all time. His work resonated with me on many levels. He contributed greatly to help change and improve humanity. It was speculated that Carl Jung had Aspergers Syndrome.</p>

                    <h2 class="head">Layout</h2>

                    <p class="content2">This design was created based on the different concepts related to the atmosphere. The design aimed to subtley capture these themes through use of the circular gradiant.</p>

                    <p class="content2">I wanted the gradient to draw the reader in with an unusal design. Further to support the design the layout has been centralised with a coloured border box to tone down the hard contrast of the high pitched colours in the
                      gradient. The aim was for a simple but effect layout that was focused on the message.</p>

                    <p class="content2">was getting the design to look futuristic the universe or the galaxy subtlety but not obviously. The colours iâ€™ve used are abstract to this concept but I looked at colours that could represent inner peace with my vision.</p>

                    <h2 class="head">Typesetting</h2>

                    <p class="content2">The typefaces used in this design were a mixture of sans serif and cursive category fonts. I wanted to select a font stack that would compliment my theme. My main choice was Ibarra Real Nova ironically that my daughter's
                      name Nova.</p>

                    <p class="content2">I also chose similar fonts for my stack including Lato, Montserrat, Raleway and Roboto. I wanted to use a good selection so I also used the typeface cursive and opted for Kaushan Script and were all sourced from Google
                      Fonts.</p>

                    <h2 class="head">Colour</h2>

                    <p class="content2"> The colours chosen are not indicative of my aims in design. However I loved the beautiful contrast I was able to create. I used colours that have high spiritual meaning but also are that promote inner peace and emotional
                      calm.</p>

                    <p class="content2">Blue represents the high Third eye Chakra "Ajna" and Green promotes the heart Chakra "Anahata". In some cultures like China green is a colour of good fortune and prosperity.</p>
